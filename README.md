##Overview

The HPCC-Platform is a massive parallel-processing computing platform that solves Big Data problems.

##Setup

##Usage

###Envgen

Envgen is the script that allows us to map nodes in the cluster to specific roles within the HPCC-Platform.


1) .../hpcc/files/iplist must be implemented.  You may use hpcc/files/iplist.example
as a reference for how to format the file.  The iplist file is used to help
generate the environment.xml manifest that will configure all your nodes.

2) .../hpcc/files/environment.xml automatically generated by the hpcc instance with 
role => 'master' set. This instantiation of the hpcc class needs to be on the 
puppetmaster as it controls the generation of environment.xml, as well as acts as a
provider of the file to all the hpcc nodes within your cluster.
