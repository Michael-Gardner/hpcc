Installation
------------




Setup
-----

1) .../hpcc/files/iplist must be implemented.  You may use hpcc/files/iplist.example
as a reference for how to format the file.  The iplist file is used to help
generate the environment.xml manifest that will configure all your nodes.

2) .../hpcc/files/environment.xml automatically generated by the hpcc instance with 
role => 'master' set. This instantiation of the hpcc class needs to be on the 
puppetmaster as it controls the generation of environment.xml, as well as acts as a
provider of the file to all the hpcc nodes within your cluster.

hpcc::params
------------

hpcc/manifests/params.pp can be utilized to set default values for all your nodes.
This should be setup in a manner that matches all your hpcc nodes.  And allows you
 to easily 'include hpcc' in your environments nodes.pp file.  The master should be
instantiated seperately on your puppet master.

nodes.pp declarations
--------------------

For the master (will not be running as a computational node, only for support of 
Envgen)

class { 'hpcc':
  role => 'master',
}

For all computational nodes simply
include hpcc
